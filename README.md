# Banglore-House-Price-Prediction
![User Interface](client/UI_example.png "User Interface")

This project involves using machine learning techniques to build a regression model and apply it to a real-world problem. The model was implemented using various concepts in data science and machine learning. In addition, a web server was developed using the Flask framework to handle requests from a user interface. The project also included deploying the model to a production environment using AWS EC2 and nginx, but due to issues with the AWS subscription the cloud deployment couldn't be completed.

## Dataset
The project was completed using the [Bengaluru House Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data) dataset.

## Concepts Used
* Data Load and Cleaning
